a. What does the assertArrayEquals method do?

The assertArrayEquals method is used in JUnit to check if two arrays are equal. It compares the arrays element by element and ensures that:  
- Both arrays have the same length.
- Each corresponding pair of elements in the arrays are equal.
If the arrays are not equal, the method throws an AssertionError.

b. What will happen if the arrays a1 and a2 are not equal in testSingleDimensionalArrayEquality?

If the arrays a1 and a2 are not equal in the testSingleDimensionalArrayEquality method, the assertArrayEquals method will throw an AssertionError.
This will cause the test to fail, indicating that the arrays do not match as expected.

c. How does the assertArrayEquals method handle multi-dimensional arrays as seen in testMultiDimensionalArrayEquality?

The assertArrayEquals method handles multi-dimensional arrays by comparing them in a nested manner:  
- It first checks that the outer arrays have the same length.
- Then, it recursively compares each pair of corresponding inner arrays.
For multi-dimensional arrays to be considered equal, both the outer arrays and all corresponding inner arrays must be equal in length and content.
If any pair of corresponding inner arrays are not equal, the method will throw an AssertionError, causing the test to fail.
